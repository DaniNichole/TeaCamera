Hello,

I looked through your code and didnt see any errors.
When I clicked your camera button it went to the camera. I clicked "Show Camera" and it gave me an error code on line 124.
I went and looked at it again and didnt see anything wrong.
I ran it again and it didn't show a code but it also didn't do anything.
Other than that your Tea Strength worked great. 
If you didnt hit the "camera" button just right it asked me to choose again.
